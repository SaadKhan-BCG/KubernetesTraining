Useful Resources:
- K8s Docs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/
- Artifact Hub: https://artifacthub.io/

Ex 1. Identify resources needed for app and db deployment

Ex 2. Given populated Service and Volumes, correctly generate deployment which uses these

Ex 3. Run example application. Check logs in k9s, operating UI on localhost

Ex 4. Follow instructions in README "K8s Dashboard" to start dashboard

Ex 5. Install the mysql chart https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mysql as a dependency, add our wordpress label and run it

Ex 6. Migrate the app-deployment to helm, and add template values for volume and dbhost. Careful, the DB Hostname and password may be different in the helm chart
			Hint: Investigate the chart on artifacthub/k9s to either find the new names/ override them with the values.yml

Ex 7. Create Service Account with read only cluster access, verify it works by execing in to read-only-test container and trying kubectl commands

Ex 8. Install new metrics-server dependency, Add autoscaling for the app deployment Hint: Take a look at the HorizontalPodAutoscaler. Target CPU under 50%, scale pods between 2 and 10
			Note: Sadly the autoscaler will not work locally as the metrics server does not support docker-desktop so stats cannot be collected, but the exercise can still be attempted
